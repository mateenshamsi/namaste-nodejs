# Database

A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is designed to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Structured Data**: Information is organized in a specific format
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data
3. **Data Security**: Controls access and protects sensitive information
4. **Data Independence**: Separation of data and application logic
5. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple users can access data simultaneously

## Common Types

- Relational Databases (SQL)
- NoSQL Databases
- Object-Oriented Databases
- Document Databases
- Key-Value Stores

## Popular Database Systems

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server

## NoSQL and MongoDB

### NoSQL Overview
- Non-relational database system
- Flexible schema design
- Horizontal scalability
- Handles unstructured data efficiently

### MongoDB Features
- Document-oriented database
- JSON-like documents (BSON format)
- Rich query language
- High performance
- Built-in replication and sharding
- Ideal for:
    - Big Data applications
    - Real-time analytics
    - Content management systems
    - IoT applications
