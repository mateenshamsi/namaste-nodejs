# Understanding Node.js: V8, libuv and File Operations

Let's break down this code which demonstrates various Node.js concepts:

## Key Topics
- V8 Engine: JavaScript execution environment
- libuv: Cross-platform I/O operations library
- File Operations: Sync vs Async approaches
- Event Loop: How Node.js handles operations

## Example Code
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const https = require('https');

console.log('Starting the app...');

var a = 1078698 
var b = 20986 

https.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', (res) => {
    console.log('Response status code:', res.statusCode);
}) 

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Timeout completed after 2 seconds');
}, 2000);

fs.readFile('./file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    console.log('File read completed', data);
}) 
fs.readFileSync()

function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}   

multiply(a, b);
console.log('Multiplication result:', multiply(a, b));
```

## Code Output Explanation
1. The start message prints first
2. The sync operation (math calculation) executes immediately
3. Async operations (file read, network call, timer) are queued in the event loop
4. Timer callback executes after its delay
5. File read and network call complete based on their actual operation time
6. The end message prints last

This example showcases both synchronous and asynchronous operations in Node.js. The code starts with importing the `fs` (File System) and `https` modules. It performs multiple operations:
- A network request using `https.get()`
- A timer using `setTimeout()`
- A file read operation using `fs.readFile()`

While these async operations are ongoing, it also performs a synchronous mathematical calculation by multiplying two large numbers. The code exemplifies how Node.js handles I/O operations non-blockingly through libuv, while executing synchronous JavaScript operations through the V8 engine.

This output pattern demonstrates how Node.js processes sync operations immediately while managing async tasks efficiently through the event loop.

Output
Starting the app...
Multiplication result: 22637556228
File read completed undefined
Response status code: 200
Timeout completed after 2 seconds

## Understanding readFileSync()

`fs.readFileSync()` is a synchronous file reading operation that blocks the main thread until completion:

```javascript
// Example of blocking readFileSync
const fs = require('fs');

console.log('Start');
const data = fs.readFileSync('./file.txt', 'utf8'); // Blocks here
console.log('File:', data);
console.log('End');
```

### Key Points:
- Blocks the entire execution thread
- Prevents other code from running until file is read
- Suitable only for small files or startup configuration
- Should be avoided in request handlers or busy loops
- Can cause performance issues in high-traffic applications

### Better Alternative:
Use `fs.readFile()` for asynchronous, non-blocking operations in most cases.
