# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Overview
The SDLC is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software systems.

## Key Phases
1. **Planning**: Requirements gathering and analysis
2. **Design**: System and software design specifications
3. **Implementation**: Coding and development
4. **Testing**: Quality assurance and bug fixing
5. **Deployment**: Release and installation
6. **Maintenance**: Updates and support

## Different Methodologies
- Waterfall Model
- Agile Development
- DevOps
- Spiral Model
- Iterative Development


# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## Basic Definitions

- **Monolithic**: A software architecture where all components of an application are interconnected and operate as a single unit
- **Microservices**: An architectural style where the application is structured as a collection of small, autonomous services

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Monolithic | Microservices |
| SDLC Impact | Sequential, traditional | Parallel, iterative |
| Release Cycle | Longer release cycles | Rapid, continuous deployment |
| Development Approach | Waterfall or iterative | Agile, CI/CD focused |
| Architecture | Single, unified unit | Distributed, independent services |
| Codebase | Single codebase | Multiple codebases |
| Deployment | Single deployment | Independent deployments |
| Scaling | Entire application must scale | Individual services can scale |
| Development | Simpler development process | Complex distributed development |
| Testing | Easier to test end-to-end | Complex integration testing |
| Technology | Single technology stack | Multiple technology stacks possible |
| Database | Shared database | Independent databases |
| Team Size | Better for smaller teams | Suitable for large teams |
| Maintenance | Simple for small apps, complex for large | Complex initially, easier long-term |
| Communication | In-process calls | API/network calls |
| Reliability | Single point of failure | Partial system failures possible |
